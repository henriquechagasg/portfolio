# About

This is my personal portfolio, built in React, that has your own music player.

## Music Player
One of the things I most enjoeyd working on. For this to work, first I needed to host the songs on a Google Cloud bucket so I could pass the link for an html audio tag.
After that was done, I used react hooks for monitoring the state of the audio tag and with context-api I could share that state with other components.
