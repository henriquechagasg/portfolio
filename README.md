# About

This is my personal portfolio which has your own music player.

## Music Player
One of the things I most enjoeyd working on.
<br />
For this to work, first I needed to host my songs on a Google Cloud bucket so I could pass the link for an html audio tag.
After that, I used react hooks for monitoring the state of that tag and, using context-api, I passed that state through components.
